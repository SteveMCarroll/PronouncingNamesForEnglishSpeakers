# Pronouncing Non-English Names For English Speakers

A practical guide to how to pronounce non-English names for English speakers

The goal of this guide is to produce a simple guide to help you pronounce a surname from a non-English speaking culture that sounds reasonably correct.
In this guide, we will provide reasonable approximations using sounds that are already familiar to English speakers.    
Learning to produce non-English sounds is out of scope for this document, but lots of fun and I highly recommend it. 

## General

Rule #1 for pronouncing someone's name is what the person in question says the pronunciation of their name is should override this document!
For example, in the US, many families that immigrated many years ago have changed the way their name was pronounced from its original heritage pronunciation.
That's totally fine! Use their pronunciation!

There's an important non-obvious caveat here though. 
If you are not a native speaker of the language of the person, you should *not* assume your brain can hear their pronunciation accurately to reproduce it. 
Many languages have sounds that simply do not appear in English and if you don't speak those languages, your brain will try its best to map it to English sounds.
It will frequently fail badly.  If you've never seriously studied a foreign language, you may have never had this experience before, but it is very real.
One way to get an intuition for this is to think about how many song lyrics you've later realized you've misheard in your native language.  

## Chinese

Chinese is a complicated subject and the goal of this guide is to be practical and simple.
The vast majority of Chinese people in the world today writing their names using the English alphabet use a system called [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).
You can be confident when using this guide with people who were born in mainland China after 1950 or so but use caution with people from Taiwan, or people who emigrated from China before those periods. Cantonese speakers (especially from Hong Kong) are also not covered here (yet).

First, if you can remember only 3 things:
1) **Zh** is like a J sound (as in "Jam")
2) **X** is like a Sh sound (as in "Shot")
3) **Q** is like a Ch sound (as in "China")

These just need to be memorized.  The sound most English speakers guess in these cases is to make them sounds like the Zh sound in the middle consonant in the English word "measure".   This is very wrong and because that sound gets used for all of them (and J) it can be very confusing.   

The good news about Chinese surnames for English speakers is that there are very few of them.   The word for "the masses" in Chinese (百家姓) can be literally translated as "the old 100 surnames" because of how few there are.   Even better news is that the top 20 surnames account for more than 54% of all Chinese people's surnames. 

Here's the top 20 with the tricky ones explained:
Rank   | Pinyin | Pronunciation Tricks
------ | ------- |----------
1      | Wang    | has an "ah" vowel.  Wahng
2      | Li      |

## Japanese

Japanese only has 5 vowel sounds, a, i, u, e, o.  A as in 'father', i as a short version of 'knee' or 'bee', 'u' as in blue, 'e' like in 'set' and 'o' as in note.

In general, and in contrast to English, syllables are given equal time and emphasis.  In names like "sakura" it is very easy for English speakers to over emphasis the middle syllable.

Japanese names will very often finish with a vowel sound. It is always pronounced.  There is no 'silent e' like in 'crate', 'rare', 'bribe' etc.

The Japanese 'r' sound is produced with the tongue, not the lips and teeth.  You may find it easier to pronounce it as an 'l' or even as very soft 'd'.

Japanese names are often written family-name given-name, though Japanese people often adjust the order in an international context.  In general, it is best to confirm.

Rank   | Family Name  | Pronunciation Help
------ | -------      |----------
1      | Sato         | The second syllable is longer.
2      | Suzuki       | 
3      | Takahashi    | 
4      | Tanaka       | Every vowel should sound the same.
5      | Watanabe     | Pronounce the final e
6      | Ito          | Has a long 'o' sound at the end
7      | Yamamoto     | 
8      | Nakamura     |
9      | Kobayashi    | 
10     | Saito        | The 'o' is a long vowel here.
